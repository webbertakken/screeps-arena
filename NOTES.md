# Notes

### Movement and fatigue

- Each body part except MOVE and empty CARRY generate fatigue.
  - Example: If a creep has 3 CARRY parts and is carrying 60 energy, two of the three CARRY parts would generate fatigue
- 1 point per body part on roads, 2 on plain land, 10 on swamp.
- Each MOVE body part decreases fatigue points by 2 per tick. 
- The creep cannot move when its fatigue is greater than zero.
